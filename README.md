# Multiclass-Image-Classification

This project is based on multiclass image classification, an upgrade for binary classification which was my previous project
This project includes the usage of Tensorflow, Keras, CNN, matplotlib, OpenCV, Numpy
Algorithms used are: Relu, softmax
Otimizers used: Adam

The dataset divided in 6 classes is used
the classes are: 'buildings','forest','glacier','mountain','sea','street'
